# Dwarf Game

Dwarf Game is a 2D side-scrolling game written in assembly. The game consists of two levels:

- **Upper Level (Night Mode):** The dwarf moves through the night sky while avoiding bullets.
- **Lower Level (Day Mode):** The dwarf jumps above walls and obstacles.
- **Level Switching:** The player can switch between these levels by jumping.

## Features
- Dynamic level switching
- Shooting mechanics in the night mode
- Obstacle avoidance in the day mode
- Implemented in assembly for performance optimization
